# Depression_UI
The interface design for a depression detection and analysis system



To connect a generated model from Google's Teachable Machine to a React application, you can follow these steps:

1. Export the model: In Teachable Machine, export the generated model as a TensorFlow.js model. This will typically give you a `model.json` file and a set of weight files (`.bin` or `.weights`).

2. Set up the React project: Create a new React project or open an existing one where you want to integrate the model.

3. Install TensorFlow.js: Install the TensorFlow.js library in your React project by running the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/knn-classifier
   ```

4. Import TensorFlow.js and the model files: In your React component file, import the required TensorFlow.js libraries and the model files:

   ```jsx
   import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
   import '@tensorflow/tfjs'; // Import TensorFlow.js dependencies
   import model from './path/to/model.json'; // Import the model.json file
   import weights from './path/to/model.weights'; // Import the model weights file(s)
   ```

5. Load and use the model: In your component's code, load the model using TensorFlow.js and perform the desired predictions:

   ```jsx
   const loadModel = async () => {
     const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel(model); // Load the model
     await loadedModel.loadWeights(weights); // Load the model weights
     // Use the loaded model for predictions or further processing
   };

   useEffect(() => {
     loadModel(); // Call the loadModel function when the component mounts
   }, []);
   ```

   In the `loadModel` function, we use `tf.loadLayersModel()` to load the model from the `model.json` file, and then `loadedModel.loadWeights()` to load the weights from the weight files. You can then use the loaded model for making predictions or performing any further processing required.

   Note: Make sure to provide the correct paths to the model and weight files when importing them.

6. Use the model for predictions: Once the model is loaded, you can use it to make predictions based on your specific use case. Refer to the Teachable Machine documentation or the generated model's documentation for details on how to use the model for prediction, as it may vary depending on the model architecture and input requirements.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the model loading process and subsequent predictions.

By following these steps, you can connect your generated model from Google's Teachable Machine to your React application and leverage it for predictions or further processing within your React components.
